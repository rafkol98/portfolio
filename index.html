I am responsible for making them feel at home at Newcastle during their first few months until they get comfortable with university life. I do my best to offer to my mentees useful pieces of advice and knowledge I wished I knew when I was first starting university.

Since then, I am the chief web developer who is responsible for updating and upgrading the website on a regular basis. As the year went on, our association grew beyond our initial expectations. As of today, it has more than 65 companies as members and it keeps growing.  Its a really rewarding feeling to know that I am an essential part of something that became very successful.</p>

The website had to shut down because of a threat from a legal strike from Nintendo because of a product we were selling. Nevertheless, in the few months I worked there I gained extremely valuable experiences and learned a lot about the world of business.</p>

I made many extremely close friends that I consider my brothers until this very day. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I am extremely proud that I served my country.</p>

It uses a bias-proof value spreading system, that objectively rewards the users according to their time of entry and the number of other participants. It is a strategic game, where players will eventually win money, if they continue to play.<br><br>
                                At the core of this game, I used cloud functions to achieve complete automation. The platform is completely autonomous. 
                                This is a proof of concept, it is not functioning with real money yet.

                            <p class="mb-0 text-small font-italic text-muted">This is an android app that I and a friend of mine are currently developing as a side project. The idea is simple. We noticed that Google Maps uses a one-fit for all approach when calculating the walking time to a destination. It assumes that everyone walks at the same pace.<br><br>
                                This app aims to personalise the walking experience. When you first download justWalk it asks you to do a speed test to calculate your unique average walking pace. When that is done, you can plan trips (e.g.: I want to be at Kings Gate at 17:00 on Friday 20 November 2020). The app will calculate in the background how much time you need to get there (based on your own average pace), no matter where you are (within walking radius) and it will notify you 10 minutes before you should start walking.<br><br>
                                You can also add friends and plan meetings with them. The app will notify each one separately when to start walking to all meet at your selected location on time.
