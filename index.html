                            <p>Due to recent technological advances, single-cell assays are now firmly accepted as state-of-the-art for a wide range of biomedical projects; RNA-focused assays represent a cost-effective and quick proxy for both DNA and protein evaluations, as well as containing intrinsic expression signals. Clustering is pivotal in scRNA-seq for partitioning cells into distinct groups, setting the stage for analyses such as trajectory inference of cell-cell interactions. Recently, community detection algorithms emerged as superior for identifying transcriptomic-driven subpopulations.

                                Despite their enhanced performance, all cutting-edge community detection techniques are inherently stochastic and crisp; iterative runs result in variable partitions and interpretations even when applied to identical inputs. This variability highlights the need to replace crisp assignation with a probabilistic/fuzzy approach, i.e., fuzzy clustering, where cells can concurrently be associated with multiple clusters.
                                
                                Inspired by findings from Gribben et al. \citep{Gribben2024} on biphenotypic cells in metabolic dysfunction-associated diseases, in this project I introduce \textit{flufftail}, a comprehensive R package designed for single-cell data analysis through the angle of fuzzy clustering that aims to characterise fuzzy cells/genes and subsequently uncover insights on mechanisms that drive cellular plasticity and GRN dynamics. \textit{flufftail} exploits the variability of standard clustering approaches by proposing a fuzzy community-detection clustering through repeated stochastic clustering. I also developed a new methodology for identifying key genes (major regulatory hubs) that drive biological transitions through fuzzy gene module clustering. Furthermore, \textit{flufftail} presents a new approach for characterising gene regulatory network (GRN) dynamics and the evolution of regulatory interactions for major regulatory hub genes at different stages of the pseudotime ordering of cells. Importantly, a Shiny interface was developed, allowing interactive analysis with the package and democratising it to researchers from diverse backgrounds.
                                
                                This marks the first exploration/exploitation of GRN dynamics across different points (or bins) of pseudotime in single-cell data, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms controlling cellular plasticity, transdifferentiation, and potential therapeutic targets.</p>

                            <p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, causing nearly one in six deaths.
                                Resistance
                                to therapy continues to be a primary cause of cancer treatment failures, resulting in a
                                high
                                number of cancer-related deaths. Recent technological advancements and the availability
                                of a
                                vast amount of omics data have ushered us into a new era of precision medicine, a
                                paradigm
                                shift away from one-size-fits-all cancer treatment toward patient-specific medicine. The
                                main aim of this project was the in-depth statistical analysis of the NUC-7738 drug
                                using
                                multiple omics datasets and the development of machine learning (ML) models that can be
                                used
                                to predict in silico whether an individual would be sensitive or resistant. Through data
                                analysis and visualisation, tumour origins that are likely to be sensitive and resistant
                                to
                                the drug were identified. Extensive correlation analysis identified genes that highly
                                correlate with drug efficacy across different omics datasets (gene expressions,
                                alternative
                                polyadenylation, proteomics, gene effect, mutations). Furthermore, through a range of
                                feature selection and ML methods, predictive models were created that can be used to
                                predict
                                drug response given a patient’s molecular characteristics. A multi-omics model that
                                incorporates all the models’ predictions was also attempted, with modest success.
                                Clustering
                                cancer cell lines based on their alternative polyadenylation usage yielded two clusters
                                with
                                varied drug sensitivity. Ensemble clustering of the gene effect dataset revealed genes
                                with
                                similar dependency profiles, which is especially beneficial when it comes to identifying
                                alternative druggable targets for genes of interest that are not conventionally
                                druggable.
                                Finally, correlation analysis when the drug was combined with two other promising drugs
                                was
                                performed. This showcased that when the drug was used in combination with Paclitaxel,
                                the
                                HINT1 gene, which is required to activate NUC- 7738, had a significantly stronger
                                correlation with drug efficacy.</p>

                            <p>Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death worldwide, killing
                                thousands
                                of people
                                every day. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have brought new ways to diagnose
                                CVD.

                                to enable cardiologists to visualize and predict their patient's condition in seconds.

                                Following a discussion with a physicist friend, I created a simple website that allows
                                you to use quantum random numbers to escape determinism!
                                <br>
                                The inability to predict the outcome of a process is defined as randomness. When rolling
                                a die, for example, it is impossible to predict what number will come up. It is
                                important to note, however, that randomness is not inherent in the process. A dice roll
                                obeys the laws of mechanics and can be predicted if the initial conditions are known
                                precisely and computing power is sufficient. Similarly, when a computer chooses an
                                option at random, the numbers remain deterministic because they are generated using a
                                seed value, which is required to initialize the algorithm. If the same seed value is
                                used, the same sequence of "random" numbers will be generated. While this is adequate
                                for some applications, the outcome can be predicted if the seed value and algorithm are
                                known. Processes that follow precise laws are referred to as deterministic.
                                <br>
                                Laplace famously stated that if an intelligence had complete knowledge of the universe
                                at a given instant and knew the laws of nature, it would be able to predict all future
                                and past events. This means that everything we do in life, including you reading this
                                text, is determined by the initial conditions of the universe.
                                <br>
                                Later, physicists discovered quantum phenomena, which are fundamentally random and
                                involve elementary particles such as electrons and photons. No matter how much we know
                                about the initial conditions, the outcome of these processes cannot be predicted.
                                However, quantum phenomena exist only at the microscopic level and have no effect on
                                processes at the human scale.
                                <br>
                                Here's where our website comes in. Quantum random number generators use the inherent
                                randomness of quantum processes to generate a sequence of random numbers that, in
                                theory, cannot be predicted. We use this to quantum randomly select one of the options
                                you enter, allowing you to bring quantum randomness to the macroscopic scale and
                                theoretically enjoy experiences and memories that are truly free of determinism.

                                My prototype is a smart physical device that assists students in studying using the

                                I have been using this technique to divide my study sessions into small, highly focused
                                chunks separated by short breaks since I was fifteen years old. I have always wished for
                                a system that would allow me to track this habit while also visualising and rewarding my
                                progress in a meaningful way.
                                This prototype is based on this concept and provides a complete system to accomplish
                                that.
